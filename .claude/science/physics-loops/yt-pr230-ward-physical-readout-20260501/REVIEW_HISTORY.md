# Review History

Self-review disposition: pass for boundary/support packaging; block for any
retained-closure claim.

Review checks performed:

- Status firewall: notes and loop pack use `open`, `exact negative boundary`,
  or `conditional-support`; no artifact claims retained closure.
- Definition trap: the operator-matching candidate does not define the top
  Yukawa by an `H_unit` matrix element.
- Observation trap: observed top mass and observed `y_t` are not proof inputs.
- Audit trap: existing non-clean parents are listed as open imports, not used
  as retained dependencies.
- Runner hygiene: all three new runners execute with `FAIL=0`; the Ward repair
  runner is a boundary runner rather than an intentionally failing CI check.
- SSB subderivation review: the runner correctly distinguishes the doublet
  Yukawa coefficient `sqrt(2) m/v` from the physical `h t t` vertex `m/v` and
  does not claim either determines source normalization.
- Kappa obstruction review: the countermodels vary only `kappa_H` and keep the
  same counts and SSB identity, so the negative boundary is targeted rather
  than a broad no-go against Ward repair.
- LSZ residue review: the countermodels preserve `R_conn` while varying pole
  residue, so the note does not attack color-channel arithmetic; it attacks
  only the unsupported promotion from channel ratio to physical external leg.
- Chirality selector review: the enumeration is complete over the four
  one-Higgs candidates in the repo hypercharge convention and keeps all
  non-clean parents behind the status firewall.
- Common dressing review: the countermodels vary scalar and gauge dressing
  separately while preserving the tree-level source ratio, which targets only
  the missing equality theorem and does not reuse alpha_LM or plaquette input.
- Scalar pole-residue current-surface review: the models hold all current
  visible algebraic data fixed and vary only the missing pole-residue/dressing
  data, so the no-go targets underdetermination rather than the tree-level
  `1/sqrt(6)` arithmetic.
- Closure route certificate review: the route list separates retained closure
  from new-premise/admitted-selector paths and keeps PR #230 draft/open.
- Direct measurement scale review: the calculation uses the existing
  mass-bracket certificate scale and does not claim production evidence; it
  blocks current-scale production as a closure strategy.
- Key-blocker closure-attempt review: the runner checks every plausible current
  authority family against both required missing pieces, scalar pole residue
  and relative scalar/gauge dressing, and finds no retained closure.
- Scalar source two-point stretch review: the logdet curvature formula uses
  only A_min and functional derivatives, while the free-bubble residue scan
  explicitly avoids observed values and H_unit readout authority.
- Stuck fan-out review: the finite-volume near-match is rejected by a direct
  volume-drift check; HS/RPA is selected only as a conditional successor.
- HS/RPA pole-condition review: the runner does not add a contact coupling to
  A_min; it records that deriving such a coupling from the Wilson gauge ladder
  is the next theorem.
- Ladder-kernel scout review: bounded-support only; explicit mass, IR, and
  simplified projector dependence prevent retained-proposal wording.
- Scalar ladder input-audit review: formula-level `D_psi`, `D_gluon`, and
  scalar/gauge kinematic equality are allowed as exact support, while
  alpha_LM, plaquette, `u0`, and `H_unit` surfaces are explicitly forbidden as
  proof inputs.
- Projector-normalization review: the same finite kernel can cross or fail the
  pole criterion under source/projector normalization changes, so the note is
  an exact negative boundary against using kinematic equality as LSZ readout.
- HQET direct-route review: the static normalized correlator is intentionally
  held fixed while absolute heavy masses vary; this proves an import boundary
  for absolute `m_t`, not a rejection of HQET as an engineering method.
- Static mass matching review: the runner separates raw and subtracted
  correlators and then varies the `am0 + delta_m` decomposition, so the result
  targets only the missing absolute-mass matching condition.
- Legendre normalization review: all tested `kappa` choices satisfy the
  Legendre identity while changing curvature and the Yukawa readout, so the
  artifact blocks only the source-normalization shortcut and leaves a
  pole/kinetic theorem as the positive target.
- Free scalar two-point review: the runner tests the exact free logdet bubble
  and only concludes absence of a free inverse-curvature zero; it does not
  claim interacting scalar poles are impossible.

## Review-Loop Backpressure — Campaign Block 2

Local review-loop disposition after the stretch/fan-out/kernel artifacts:

```text
Code / Runner: PASS
Physics Claim Boundary: OPEN / BOUNDED SUPPORT
Imports / Support: DISCLOSED
Nature Retention: OPEN
Repo Governance: PASS for PR230-local loop pack; no repo-wide authority surfaces updated
Audit Compatibility: PASS
```

Findings applied:

- no bare retained/promoted source-note status lines were introduced;
- observed `m_t`, observed `y_t`, and observed Higgs/top data are not proof
  inputs in any new runner;
- `H_unit` matrix-element readout appears only as a forbidden failure mode;
- scalar contact coupling `G`, scalar-channel ladder kernel, IR regulator, and
  scalar projector are now explicit open imports;
- the near-match to `1/sqrt(6)` is demoted by the volume-drift check rather
  than used as evidence.

Checks:

The audit pipeline and strict lint completed with no errors and the same five
pre-existing warnings.

Open review risk:

- The next positive theorem must not smuggle in the physical Higgs carrier by
  simply renaming the scalar source.  It needs a functional readout theorem.
- The next scalar-ladder theorem must also derive the scalar projector/source
  normalization before using an eigenvalue crossing as physical evidence.
- The next HQET/direct theorem must derive additive mass and matching rather
  than calibrating the static mass to the observed top.
- A static matching theorem cannot be accepted if it simply chooses the
  residual mass that reproduces `172.56 GeV`.
- A Legendre/source theorem cannot be accepted if it fixes `kappa_H` by a field
  naming convention rather than by residue or kinetic normalization.
- A free-bubble theorem cannot be accepted as Higgs-carrier closure unless it
  introduces and derives an interacting denominator or a canonical kinetic term.
