# Review History

Self-review disposition: pass for boundary/support packaging; block for any
retained-closure claim.

Review checks performed:

- Status firewall: notes and loop pack use `open`, `exact negative boundary`,
  or `conditional-support`; no artifact claims retained closure.
- Definition trap: the operator-matching candidate does not define the top
  Yukawa by an `H_unit` matrix element.
- Observation trap: observed top mass and observed `y_t` are not proof inputs.
- Audit trap: existing non-clean parents are listed as open imports, not used
  as retained dependencies.
- Runner hygiene: all three new runners execute with `FAIL=0`; the Ward repair
  runner is a boundary runner rather than an intentionally failing CI check.
- SSB subderivation review: the runner correctly distinguishes the doublet
  Yukawa coefficient `sqrt(2) m/v` from the physical `h t t` vertex `m/v` and
  does not claim either determines source normalization.
- Kappa obstruction review: the countermodels vary only `kappa_H` and keep the
  same counts and SSB identity, so the negative boundary is targeted rather
  than a broad no-go against Ward repair.
- LSZ residue review: the countermodels preserve `R_conn` while varying pole
  residue, so the note does not attack color-channel arithmetic; it attacks
  only the unsupported promotion from channel ratio to physical external leg.
- Chirality selector review: the enumeration is complete over the four
  one-Higgs candidates in the repo hypercharge convention and keeps all
  non-clean parents behind the status firewall.
- Common dressing review: the countermodels vary scalar and gauge dressing
  separately while preserving the tree-level source ratio, which targets only
  the missing equality theorem and does not reuse alpha_LM or plaquette input.

Open review risk:

- The next positive theorem must not smuggle in the physical Higgs carrier by
  simply renaming the scalar source.  It needs a functional readout theorem.
