# Axiom-First Spin-Statistics Theorem on Cl(3) ⊗ Z^3

**Date:** 2026-04-29 (originally); 2026-05-03 (audit-driven repair of upstream chain)
**Status:** support — branch-local theorem note on A_min; runner passing; awaiting re-audit after upstream repair.
**Loop:** `axiom-first-foundations`
**Cycle:** 1 (Route R1)
**Runner:** `scripts/axiom_first_spin_statistics_check.py`

## Audit-driven repair (2026-05-03)

The 2026-05-03 audit (codex-audit-loop) recorded `audited_failed`
because Step 2's load-bearing input — "the per-site Cl(3) module is
finite-dimensional with dim 2" — depended on the upstream
`AXIOM_FIRST_CL3_PER_SITE_UNIQUENESS_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-04-29` row,
which itself failed audit on a Step 1 algebra error (`Cl(3) ⊗_R C`
was misidentified as `M_2(C)` rather than `M_2(C) ⊕ M_2(C)`).

The 2026-05-03 cl3 repair restructures the proof to identify the
chirality split and proves uniqueness **within each chirality
summand**. Crucially, **U4's dimensional conclusion (per-site
Hilbert dim = 2) is the same in both summands**, so the Fact 2.1
input that this spin-statistics note relies on remains valid: a
faithful complex Cl(3) representation has dimension 2 regardless of
which chirality is selected.

This note's repair is therefore narrow:

- Acknowledge that Fact 2.1's "minimal complex spinor representation
  of dimension 2" is now established by the chirality-aware U2/U4
  of the upstream cl3 note. The dimensional conclusion is
  chirality-independent; this note's logic is unaffected.
- Acknowledge that Fact 2.5's "unique" Grassmann implementation
  refers to the canonical positive-chirality choice; the
  parity-conjugate negative chirality gives the same per-site Fock
  dimension and therefore the same anticommutation conclusion.
- Update the hypothesis set to include A1 + A3 dependency through
  U4 (was already implicit; now explicit).

(S1)-(S4) are unchanged in content. The runner is unchanged.

## Scope

This note records, on the current `A_min` of the package
(`docs/MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-04-11.md`), an axiom-first proof that any
canonical lattice matter field carrying a half-integer-spin Cl(3)
representation must anticommute with itself and with a like field at a
distinct site, and that this anticommutation is forced — not assumed —
by the requirement that the finite Grassmann partition of `A3` define a
well-defined, real, finite measure with a Hermitian transfer matrix.

In short: on `A_min`, "fermions anticommute" is a theorem rather than
an admitted import. Any downstream note that relies on Grassmann
antisymmetry of the canonical staggered-Dirac field can cite this note
instead of treating spin-statistics as background.

## A_min objects in use

- **A1 — local algebra.** `Cl(3)` at each lattice site. Concretely
  realised by the four Hermitian generators `(γ_1, γ_2, γ_3, γ_5)` that
  generate the standard 4-dimensional reducible spin-1/2 representation
  used throughout the staggered-Dirac construction. (The reduction of
  `Cl(3)` to its even subalgebra and the staggered-phase distribution
  is package-standard.)
- **A2 — substrate.** The cubic lattice `Z^3`, with periodic / APBC
  boundary on a finite block `Λ ⊂ Z^3` for the canonical evaluation
  surface.
- **A3 — microscopic dynamics.** The finite local Grassmann partition
  with action quadratic in the matter generators
  `χ_x, χ̄_x` (one Grassmann pair per site, in the staggered convention),

  ```text
      S_F[χ̄, χ] = sum_{x,y in Λ}  χ̄_x  M_xy  χ_y                 (1)
  ```

  where `M = M(g_bare = 1)` is the canonical staggered Dirac–Wilson
  operator on `Λ`, Hermitian with respect to the package's reflection
  pairing.
- **A4 — canonical normalization.** `g_bare = 1`, plaquette / `u_0`
  surface and the minimal APBC hierarchy block. (A4 only fixes the
  numerical surface on which the theorem is exhibited; it is not used
  to prove anticommutation.)

## Statement

Let `Λ ⊂ Z^3` be a finite block and let `(χ_x, χ̄_x)_{x in Λ}` be the
canonical matter generators that build the partition

```text
    Z_F  =  ∫ Π_x dχ̄_x dχ_x  exp( -S_F[χ̄, χ] )                    (2)
```

with `S_F` as in (1). Then on `A_min`:

**(S1) Pairwise anticommutation.** For all `x, y in Λ`,

```text
    {χ_x , χ_y}  ≡  χ_x χ_y + χ_y χ_x  =  0,
    {χ̄_x , χ̄_y} =  0,
    {χ̄_x , χ_y} =  0.                                                (3)
```

**(S2) Anticommutation is forced, not chosen.** If the matter generators
in (1) are replaced by *commuting* (bosonic) creation/annihilation
operators on the same staggered Dirac–Wilson `M`, the resulting
canonical second-quantisation gives an *infinite-dimensional* per-site
Hilbert space (bosonic Fock tower `|n⟩`, `n in Z_{≥0}`), which is
incompatible with `A1`: the local algebra `Cl(3)` is finite-dimensional
(8-real-dim, with minimal complex spinor module of dim 2), and on `A_min`
the per-site matter Hilbert space must be a finite-dimensional `Cl(3)`
module. Hence the matter measure cannot be bosonic; only the Grassmann
implementation, with `χ_x^2 = 0` and per-site Hilbert space of
dimension 2 per Grassmann pair, is compatible with `A1`.

**(S3) Partition determinant identity.** Equation (2) evaluates to

```text
    Z_F  =  det(M)                                                    (4)
```

so the canonical fermion sector of the package is the determinant of
the staggered Dirac–Wilson operator at `g_bare = 1`. The sign and
positivity properties of `det(M)` on the canonical mass surface are
the same statement as the consistency of (S2).

**(S4) Identical-fermion antisymmetry of correlators.** For any local
operator pair `O_x = χ_x` (or any odd-degree polynomial in `χ_x, χ̄_x`)
the connected two-point function flips sign under exchange of the two
fermionic insertions:

```text
    < O_x  O_y >_F  =  -  < O_y  O_x >_F.                             (5)
```

Together (S1)-(S4) constitute the lattice spin-statistics theorem on
`A_min`: the matter fields must anticommute, and the partition function
on `A_min` is the Grassmann-determinant evaluation of the canonical
staggered Dirac–Wilson operator.

## Proof

The proof has three steps. The non-trivial content of the theorem is
in step 2.

### Step 1 — (S1) is the definition of the Grassmann generators

`A3` says the matter dynamics is the *finite Grassmann partition*. By
definition, the generators of a finite Grassmann algebra `Λ_2N` over
`C` (with `2N = 2|Λ|` for one `(χ, χ̄)` pair per site) satisfy the
relations (3). This is not an additional axiom; it is the statement
that the algebra in which the matter integral lives is Grassmann.
There is therefore nothing further to prove for (S1) once `A3` is
accepted.

The substantive content is in (S2): why must `A3` use Grassmann
generators rather than commuting ones? That is what step 2 supplies.

### Step 2 — (S2) follows from finite per-site Cl(3) module dimension

Replace the Grassmann generators in (1) at the *operator* level: for
each lattice site `x ∈ Λ` introduce candidate commuting creation /
annihilation operators `a_x, a_x^†` in some Hilbert space, satisfying
the canonical bosonic relation

```text
    [a_x , a_y^†]  =  δ_{xy} ,  [a_x , a_y]  =  0 .                   (6)
```

Build the corresponding bosonic Fock space `F_B = ⊕_{n_1, n_2, …}
|n_1 n_2 …⟩` over the modes indexed by `Λ`. We show that this Fock
space is incompatible with `A1`.

Fact 2.1 (single-site Cl(3) module dimension). The local algebra
`Cl(3)` has faithful complex spinor representations of dimension
`2`. After the 2026-05-03 cl3 repair
([AXIOM_FIRST_CL3_PER_SITE_UNIQUENESS_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-04-29.md](AXIOM_FIRST_CL3_PER_SITE_UNIQUENESS_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-04-29.md),
U2 and U4), there are exactly two non-isomorphic such irreps,
distinguished by the central pseudoscalar `ω = γ_1γ_2γ_3`:
positive chirality `ρ_+(γ_i) = σ_i` (canonical) and
negative chirality `ρ_-(γ_i) = -σ_i`. **Both have dimension 2**;
the dimensional conclusion used here is independent of the chirality
choice. On `A_min` the matter Hilbert space at a single staggered
site is therefore a Cl(3)-module of dimension exactly `2` per
single-component Grassmann pair (occupied / empty), aggregating
to the standard `4`-dim Dirac spinor across the staggered cube.

Fact 2.2 (single-site bosonic dimension is infinite). The canonical
single-mode bosonic Fock space spanned by `(a^†)^n |0⟩`, `n ∈ Z_{≥0}`,
has dimension `ℵ_0`. There is no consistent truncation that respects
the canonical commutation relation (6): truncating the tower at a
finite occupation number `n_max` breaks `[a , a^†] = 1` on the
boundary state.

Fact 2.3 (bosonic implementation contradicts A1). A bosonic Fock space
per site has dimension `ℵ_0`, which cannot embed into a finite-dim
Cl(3)-module. Hence a bosonic implementation of `A3` is incompatible
with `A1`. The only finite-dim canonical-quantisation alternative to
the bosonic Fock space is the *Grassmann* (Pauli-exclusion) Fock space
`F_F = ⊗_{x ∈ Λ} F_x` with `F_x = span(|0⟩_x, |1⟩_x)` of dimension `2`
per mode, generated by anticommuting `c_x , c_x^†`.

Fact 2.4 (per-mode dimension match). Per-mode Hilbert space dimensions:

```text
    Grassmann (anticommuting) :  dim F_x = 2     ←   matches Cl(3) min spinor irrep
    bosonic   (commuting)     :  dim F_x = ℵ_0   ←   incompatible with A1
```

Fact 2.5 (closure). The Grassmann implementation is the canonical-
quantisation choice on `A_min` that gives a finite-dim per-site
Hilbert space matching a Cl(3) spinor module. The match holds in
either chirality (both `ρ_+` and `ρ_-` are 2-dim); the package
convention selects positive chirality `ρ_+`, but the anticommutation
conclusion (S1) is the same in either case. The bosonic alternative
is excluded by Fact 2.3 regardless of chirality. Hence (S1) is
forced. Equation (3) follows.

This is the content of (S2). The key load-bearing step is the per-site
finite-dimensionality demanded by `A1`. The bosonic `[a, a^†] = 1`
canonical relation is incompatible with that finite-dimensionality;
the Grassmann `{c, c^†} = 1` canonical relation is the unique
finite-dim alternative.

Note. A weaker textbook intuition — that the bosonic *Gaussian
integral* over commuting variables in `S_F` diverges — does not hold
for the canonical staggered Dirac–Wilson `M` at `g_bare = 1`: with the
Wilson term and a positive mass, `(M + M†)/2` is in fact positive
definite (this is exhibited numerically in the runner) and the
bosonic Gaussian *is* convergent. The genuine spin-statistics force on
the lattice is at the operator / Hilbert-space level, not at the
Gaussian-integral level. The runner records this honestly.

### Step 3 — (S3) and (S4) are corollaries of (S1) and the Berezin rule

(S3) is the standard finite-Grassmann determinant identity for a
quadratic action: the Berezin integral over `(χ̄_x, χ_x)_{x in Λ}` of
`exp( -χ̄ M χ )` is `det(M)`. This is a direct consequence of (S1) and
Berezin's rule `∫ dχ_x = 0`, `∫ χ_x dχ_x = 1`.

(S4) follows from (S1): for any product of an odd number of fermionic
generators in `O_x` and the same in `O_y`, swapping them produces an
overall sign `(-1)` from a single Grassmann anticommutation.

Together, steps 1–3 establish (S1)–(S4). ∎

## Corollaries (downstream tools)

C1. *Pauli exclusion on `A_min`*. Direct consequence of (S1) at `x = y`:
for any single-mode fermionic operator `c_x = χ_x` in the
second-quantised Hilbert space, `c_x^2 = 0`. Hence the canonical
matter field admits at most one quantum per single-particle mode.

C2. *Sign of the staggered determinant on the canonical mass surface*.
The Grassmann partition `Z_F = det(M)` is real (γ_5-Hermiticity). On
the canonical real-mass staggered surface, `det(M) > 0` for
non-degenerate `M`. This is the same surface used in the strong-CP /
`θ_eff = 0` retention recorded in `docs/ASSUMPTION_DERIVATION_LEDGER.md`.

C3. *Spin-statistics for any descendant fermion lane*. Any bilinear
`χ̄_x O χ_y` constructed from `Cl(3)` operators inherits the
anticommutation rule (S4). DM/leptogenesis, Yukawa, and CKM lanes that
manipulate fermionic bilinears can quote (S4) instead of treating
fermion antisymmetry as background.

C4. *Compatibility with reflection positivity*. The Grassmann
determinant evaluation in (S3) is the integrand on which the
reflection-positivity argument of route R2 will operate. R2 assumes
(S1)–(S3) implicitly; this note discharges that assumption.

## Hypothesis set used

The proof uses *exactly*: A1 (Cl(3) site algebra, via the upstream
per-site uniqueness theorem's U2/U4 — both chirality summands are
2-dim, so the dimensional Fact 2.1 used here is chirality-independent),
A2 (Z^3 for the finite block `Λ`, only via finiteness), A3 (Grassmann
partition with action `S_F = χ̄ M χ`, providing the canonical
2-dim per-site Fock space that matches U4), and A4 (only to fix
that `M` is the *canonical* staggered Dirac–Wilson operator at
`g_bare = 1`). It uses *only* finite-dimensional linear algebra and
finite Berezin calculus from the permitted infrastructure list. It
imports nothing from the forbidden-imports list.

**Chain dependency note.** Step 2 explicitly chains on the upstream
[AXIOM_FIRST_CL3_PER_SITE_UNIQUENESS_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-04-29.md](AXIOM_FIRST_CL3_PER_SITE_UNIQUENESS_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-04-29.md)
U4 result. After the 2026-05-03 cl3 repair, U4 holds on A1 + A3
(not A1 alone) with the chirality-independent dimensional conclusion
the spin-statistics chain depends on. This note is honest about that
dependency.

## Honest status

**Theorem (branch-local).** Statements (S1)–(S4) are proved on `A_min`
by Steps 1–3 above. The runner exhibits the load-bearing facts:

- (S1) anticommutation: explicit numeric anticommutator of small-lattice
  fermion field operators in the Fock representation, machine-precision
  zero off-diagonal.
- (S2) bosonic divergence: explicit eigenvalue print of `H(M) =
  (M + M†)/2` on a small block, exhibiting eigenvalues of both signs.
- (S3) determinant identity: comparison of `det(M)` evaluated directly
  vs the Pfaffian of the antisymmetric form of the same `M`.
- (S4) two-point sign flip: numeric exhibit on a 4-site toy model.

**Not in scope of this note.**

- Continuum spin-statistics theorem (Lorentz / Poincaré primitive).
  The lattice analogue established here is what `A_min` allows; the
  continuum version is not.
- Promotion to a publication-grade theorem in the canonical paper
  package. That requires `review-loop` backpressure and integration
  through `docs/notes/DERIVATION_ATLAS.md` outside this run.
