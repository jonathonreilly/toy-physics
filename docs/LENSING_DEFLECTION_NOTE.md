# Gravitational Deflection / Lensing Sweep — Power-Law Positive (NOT 1/b)

**Date:** 2026-04-07 (revised after Lane L+ H=0.25 fine refinement)
**Status:** bounded functional-form diagnostic — at H=0.25 fine refinement, `kubo_true(b)` on the asymptotic subset b in {3, 4, 5, 6} gives a **clean power law with R2 = 0.998** but **slope = -1.43**, NOT the -1 expected from Newton/Einstein 1/b lensing. Refinement steepens the slope: -1.03 at H=0.35 on b in {2..6} -> -1.27 at H=0.35 on b in {3..6} -> **-1.43 at H=0.25 on b in {3..6}** (R2 0.94 -> 0.94 -> 0.998). The original Lane L "matches 1/b lensing" headline (medium-only, slope -1.03) is **downgraded**: refinement is moving the slope away from -1, not toward it. What survives is **a clean power-law functional form** (R2 > 0.998 at the finest refinement) with an exponent around -1.4 to -1.5 — a meaningful gravity-side functional-form diagnostic but NOT standard Newton/Einstein 1/b lensing. The b=3 reference point matches Lane alpha's continuum value (+5.986043) to 0.2%, which is a strong consistency check on the harness.

## Artifact chain

The retained load-bearing result is the H=0.25 Lane L+ slope fit on
`b ∈ {3,4,5,6}`. The original Lane L H=0.5/0.35 sweep is preserved
below for context but is no longer the load-bearing artifact.

## Question

The propagator action `S = L(1−f)` is literally Fermat's principle
with refractive index `n = 1 − f`. A mass sources `f ∝ 1/r`, so the
beam path through that field is a geodesic in a gradient-index
medium — the same formalism as weak-field gravitational lensing.

Weak-field gravitational lensing predicts a deflection angle

    α(b) = (constant) / b

where `b` is the impact parameter (perpendicular distance of the
undeflected ray from the mass). Both Newton and Einstein give this
1/b functional form; they differ only in the prefactor (Einstein's
is twice Newton's).

The question: **does the program's beam deflection follow
α(b) ∝ 1/b?** If yes, we have a direct connection between the
lattice model and recognizable gravitational-lensing physics.

## Setup

Reusing the Kubo-continuum-limit machinery (Lane α's parallel
perturbation propagator + finite-difference dM cross-check):

- Fam1 grown DAG (drift=0.20, restore=0.70, seed=0)
- Beam: single source at origin (iy=0, iz=0, layer=0)
- Mass: at (x_src = round(NL/3)·H, y=0, z_src = b) where b is the
  impact parameter in physical units
- Field: imposed 1/r with `s = S_phys = 0.004`, regularizer 0.1
- Impact parameters swept: b ∈ {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0}
- Refinements: H ∈ {0.5, 0.35}  (memory-feasible 2-refinement sweep)

For each (H, b), compute:
- `dM(b)` = finite-difference deflection at s = S_phys
- `kubo_true(b)` = parallel perturbation propagator's first-order
  coefficient at s = 0

## Result

### Per-b measurements

| b | coarse dM (H=0.5) | medium dM (H=0.35) | medium kubo_true |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1.0 | **−0.0143** | **−0.0134** | **−2.29** |
| 2.0 | +0.0191 | +0.0284 | +6.96 |
| 3.0 | +0.0346 | +0.0242 | +5.97 |
| 4.0 | +0.0261 | +0.0124 | +3.34 |
| 5.0 | +0.0135 | +0.0126 | +3.06 |
| 6.0 | +0.0124 | +0.0096 | +2.36 |

At b = 3.0 the medium `kubo_true = +5.97` matches the Lane α
continuum result (+5.986) at its reference configuration to within
0.3%. That's consistent.

### The near-field pathology at b = 1

At b = 1.0, **both H=0.5 and H=0.35 give negative deflection**
(dM = −0.014, −0.013). The sign check labels this "AWAY from the
mass." This is NOT a bug — it's the natural behavior of a
diffracting beam when the mass is inside the beam's transverse
extent:

- The beam starts as a point source at iy=iz=0, layer 0
- It spreads as it propagates; by the mass's x-layer it has a
  significant transverse width
- At b = 1 (physical z), the mass is inside the beam's width
- Parts of the beam's amplitude are on either side of the mass
- The weighted centroid does not shift simply "toward" the mass
  because the field is strongly asymmetric over the beam's support

This is a near-field regime, not a lensing regime. The lensing
formalism assumes the ray (or beam centroid) passes the mass at
clear distance `b`. For b ≤ 1 in our lattice, that assumption
fails.

### Restricted fits — the asymptotic lensing regime

Excluding the b = 1 near-field point, fit log|kubo_true| vs log(b):

| Subset | Refinement | slope | R² | \|slope−(−1)\| |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| b ∈ {2..6} | H=0.5 | −0.470 | 0.37 | 0.530 |
| **b ∈ {2..6}** | **H=0.35** | **−1.029** | **0.937** | **0.029** |
| b ∈ {3..6} | H=0.5 | −1.281 | 0.971 | 0.281 |
| **b ∈ {3..6}** | **H=0.35** | **−1.269** | **0.937** | **0.269** |

And for the finite-difference `dM` (the direct centroid
displacement, not the analytic Kubo coefficient):

| Subset | Refinement | slope | R² | \|slope−(−1)\| |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **b ∈ {2..6}** | **H=0.35** | **−1.033** | **0.911** | **0.033** |
| b ∈ {3..6} | H=0.35 | −1.223 | 0.864 | 0.223 |

**This medium-refinement fit was the initial signal, not the retained
endpoint.** At `H=0.35` on `b ∈ {2..6}`, `kubo_true` gave slope
`−1.03` with `R² = 0.94`, and the corresponding `dM` fit gave the
same slope with slightly lower `R² = 0.91`. That medium-`H`
`≈ 1/b` reading was later overturned by the `H=0.25` refinement and
should be read as a provisional intermediate result only.

The b ∈ {3..6} fit is slightly steeper (≈ −1.27) at both
refinements — this suggests the b = 2 point is in a transition
regime where the lensing law is approaching its asymptotic form.
So the gravity-side positive here is best read as:

- a strong restricted-fit match on b ∈ {2..6}
- with a stricter asymptotic subset b ∈ {3..6} that is still close
  to 1/b but noisier and steeper

### Coarse refinement is noisier

The coarse (H=0.5) fits are much worse (R² 0.37 on b ∈ {2..6}) and
give slopes in a wide range (−0.47 to −1.28 depending on subset).
This is the same lattice-resolution issue seen in Lane δ: the
coarse grid is not a reliable guide to continuum behavior. The
medium refinement is where the 1/b structure becomes clean.

## What the combined L / L+ lane establishes

1. **The gravity-side deflection observable is a clean power law** on
   the fine asymptotic subset b ∈ {3..6}:
   - `kubo_true`: slope = `−1.4335`, `R² = 0.9984`
   - `dM`: slope = `−1.5162`, `R² = 0.9954`
2. **The exponent is not the Newton/Einstein `−1` law** on the tested
   fine subset. The medium H=0.35 `≈ −1` fit was a provisional
   coincidence that did not survive refinement.
3. **The analytic and finite-difference measurements remain
   self-consistent** in the stronger sense that both converge to the
   same qualitative conclusion: a steep non-standard power law with
   excellent log-log linearity.
4. **The b=3 reference point is exceptionally stable**:
   `kubo_true = +5.986043` at H=0.25 matches Lane α's retained
   continuum value essentially exactly.
5. **The near-field pathology at b ≤ 1 is real and persistent**:
   the centroid still deflects away from the mass there, so the
   far-field fit must stay restricted.
6. **This remains the first retained gravity-side functional-form
   match in the program**, but the match is now to a clean
   non-standard power law rather than standard weak-field `1/b`
   lensing.

## What this does NOT establish

- **The prefactor (Newton vs Einstein).** Both theories predict 1/b;
  they differ in the coefficient (4GM/c²b vs 2GM/c²b). Our dimensionless
  units don't let us distinguish. We only have the *power law*, not the
  *physical coefficient*.
- **A final continuum-stable exponent.** We now have 3 refinements at
  some b values, but the slope is still drifting with H
  (`−1.27 -> −1.43` on kubo_true over b ∈ {3..6}), so the continuum
  exponent is not yet settled.
- **Family portability.** Fam1 only. Lane α++ showed Fam2 has
  convergence problems for `kubo_true`; the lensing slope on Fam2
  could be different or also not converge.
- **Large-b asymptotics.** The fine lane only reached the asymptotic
  subset b ∈ {3..6}, and PW=6 caps the transverse range. A wider PW and
  larger b are needed to tell “true non-standard exponent” from
  “transition regime not yet at 1/b.”
- **Full deflection-angle measurement.** We're reporting `dM / (full
  propagation length)` as a proxy for the deflection angle α. A
  proper measurement would use entry/exit ray angles, not centroid
  displacement.

## Lane L+ — H=0.25 fine refinement (added 2026-04-07)

### Why this lane was needed

The original Lane L (above) was a 2-refinement sweep H ∈ {0.5, 0.35}.
The medium fit gave slope ≈ −1.03 and was framed as "matches 1/b
gravitational lensing." But Lane δ+ in this same session showed
that 2-refinement results can be misleading: small steps between
two coarse refinements can mimic convergence, and adding a third
refinement reveals the true behavior.

Lane L+ adds H=0.25 (fine) to test continuum stability of the slope.

### Cost / OOM workaround

The full sweep at 6 b-values × 3 refinements OOM-killed at H=0.25
(NL=60 grown DAGs allocated in sequence exhausted available memory
on this machine). Workaround: run each fine b-value as a separate
Python process so memory is freed by the OS between invocations,
and restrict to the asymptotic subset b ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6}.

Used [`lensing_deflection_fine_single.py`](../scripts/lensing_deflection_fine_single.py)
in a bash loop, results recorded in

### Per-b drift across all three refinements (kubo_true)

| b | H=0.5 | H=0.35 | H=0.25 | Δ(0.5→0.35) | Δ(0.35→0.25) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1.0 | −0.748 | −2.291 | +0.776 | 206% | 134% |
| 2.0 | +4.654 | +6.958 | — | 49.5% | — |
| **3.0** | **+7.062** | **+5.973** | **+5.986** | **15.4%** | **0.2%** |
| 4.0 | +5.614 | +3.339 | +3.820 | 40.5% | 14.4% |
| 5.0 | +3.664 | +3.061 | +2.826 | 16.5% | 7.7% |
| 6.0 | +3.018 | +2.360 | +2.212 | 21.8% | 6.3% |

The b=3 point matches Lane α's continuum value (+5.986043) **exactly**
(0.2% drift between H=0.35 and H=0.25). That's a strong consistency
check on the harness: when both runs hit the Lane α reference
configuration, they agree to 4 decimal places.

The other b values show 6–14% drift between H=0.35 and H=0.25 —
modest but not negligible.

### Slope fits at all three refinements (kubo_true)

| Subset | H=0.5 | H=0.35 | H=0.25 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **b ∈ {2,3,4,5,6}** | slope=−0.470 R²=0.37 | **slope=−1.029 R²=0.94** | (b=2 missing at H=0.25) |
| **b ∈ {3,4,5,6}** | slope=−1.281 R²=0.97 | slope=−1.269 R²=0.94 | **slope=−1.434 R²=0.998** |

And for the finite-difference dM:

| Subset | H=0.5 | H=0.35 | H=0.25 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| b ∈ {2,3,4,5,6} | slope=−0.550 R²=0.30 | slope=−1.033 R²=0.91 | (b=2 missing) |
| **b ∈ {3,4,5,6}** | slope=−1.624 R²=0.93 | slope=−1.223 R²=0.86 | **slope=−1.516 R²=0.995** |

### What the fine refinement reveals

**Two changes at H=0.25:**

1. **R² improves dramatically** — from 0.86–0.97 (medium) to **0.995–0.998** (fine).
   The 4-point fit on b ∈ {3..6} at H=0.25 is essentially a perfect log-log
   line. The functional form is genuinely a power law.

2. **The slope steepens** — from −1.03 at H=0.35 (b ∈ {2..6}) to **−1.43 at
   H=0.25** (b ∈ {3..6} on kubo_true) or **−1.52** (on dM). The fine
   refinement does not stabilize the slope at −1; it moves the slope
   away from −1.

The Lane L "matches 1/b lensing" framing relied on the H=0.35 slope of
−1.03 being close to the true continuum value. The H=0.25 result shows
that was a noise-pulled near-coincidence, not a structural fact. The
H=0.35 b ∈ {2..6} fit's R² of 0.94 was a warning sign — the H=0.25 fits
at the same subset (when b=2 was tested at coarse and medium) hit R²
values around 0.94 too, but b=2 has its own transition-regime issues
that we now know about.

### What survives Lane L+

- **It IS a clean power law.** R² = 0.998 on the b ∈ {3..6} subset at
  H=0.25 means the kubo_true(b) relationship is essentially a perfect
  power law in this range.
- **The exponent is ≈ −1.43 to −1.52**, not −1.
- **It is NOT standard gravitational lensing**, which would be 1/b.

Three possible interpretations of the steeper-than-1/b power:

1. **Unique lattice prediction.** The model genuinely gives `α(b) ∝ b^(−1.43)`
   in this regime, which is a different functional form from Newton/Einstein
   weak-field lensing. This would be a distinctive signature, not a match
   to known physics.
2. **Transition regime.** The actual asymptotic far-field behavior is
   `1/b` but we're sampling a near-field tail that hasn't reached its
   asymptote. Untestable here because PW=6 caps b at 6.
3. **Boundary effect.** b=6 is at the lattice transverse edge. The
   amplitude distribution at b=6 may be artificially truncated, biasing
   the kubo_true value low and steepening the slope.

The Lane L+ data alone cannot distinguish (1), (2), and (3). All three
are consistent with a clean power law on b ∈ {3..6}. To distinguish
them you'd need either a much larger PW (allowing b > 6) or an analytic
calculation of the expected b-dependence in the lattice continuum
limit.

### Honest read for Lane L overall

The Lane L "moderate positive" headline overstated. The cleaner H=0.25
data shows:

- **Positive**: a clean power law with very high R²
- **Negative**: the exponent is not −1, so this is not a 1/b lensing
  match in the standard sense
- **Open**: whether the model genuinely predicts a steeper power, or
  whether this is a transition / boundary artifact

The retained claim is now: **`kubo_true(b)` follows a clean power
law on b ∈ {3..6} at H=0.25 with exponent ≈ −1.43 ± 0.1 and R² = 0.998.**
That is a meaningful result — a clean functional form for the
deflection coefficient — but it is not the headline "matches Newton/Einstein
1/b lensing" that the original Lane L claimed.

## Frontier map adjustment (Update 14, post-Lane-L+)

| Row | Before | Lane L (H=0.35 only) | Lane L+ (H=0.25 added) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strength against harshest critique | no direct match to known physics functional forms | "1/b lensing scaling matches" | **downgraded — clean power law but exponent ≈ −1.43, NOT standard 1/b lensing** |
| Compact underlying principle | first-order Kubo derived (Fam1-continuum stable) | "1/b scaling adds a functional form" | **kubo_true(b) is a clean power law (R²=0.998) but with a non-standard exponent** |
| Experimental prediction | blocked (comparator-dominated) | "first non-blocked connection" | **partial — clean functional form but not matching known weak-field lensing** |
| Theory compression | first-order Kubo on linearity regime | "1/b b-dependence" | **sharpened differently** — kubo_true(b) is a power law, exponent depends on lattice resolution |
## Honest read

The combined L / L+ lane is still positive, but in a narrower and more
interesting way than the original Lane L writeup suggested.

- The gravity-side observable is **cleaner** at fine H than it looked at
  medium H: the power-law R² rises to ~0.998.
- The gravity-side observable is **less standard** than hoped: the slope
  moves away from `−1`, not toward it.
- So the correct retained read is not “matches textbook weak-field
  lensing,” but “produces a clean non-standard power law whose exponent
  is still H-dependent in the tested range.”

This note now stands as the record of the initial medium-`H` positive
that was later narrowed. The retained read is no longer a direct
textbook-lensing match. Instead, the current main-branch result is:

- `H=0.25` gives a much cleaner power law on `b ∈ {3..6}`,
  but with slope `≈ -1.43`, not `-1`
- ray-optics and finite-path rescues were subsequently falsified
- the active mechanism path is the adjoint-kernel / detector-response
  lane, not a medium-`H` `1/b` interpretation

What it means for the scorecard is narrower than this note originally
claimed: the program produced an encouraging medium-`H` candidate that
did not survive fine refinement as textbook weak-field lensing.

## What to attack next

1. **Adjoint-kernel reduction / derivation.** The active question is
   why the fine-`H` slope is `≈ -1.43`, not whether the medium-`H`
   fit looked close to `-1`.
2. **k sweep on the retained fine-`H` slope.** Checks whether the
   reference `≈ -1.43` law is geometric or phase-coupled.
3. **Family sweep on the retained fine-`H` slope.** Tests whether the
   fine-`H` power-law shape is Fam1-specific or shared.

## Audit-lane certificate (2026-05-09 status)

The 2026-04 audit verdict flagged that the registered runner
(`scripts/lensing_deflection_fine_single.py`) only generates a single
b-value when invoked correctly, so the load-bearing slope/R² fit at
H=0.25 on `b ∈ {3,4,5,6}` could not be verified end-to-end inside the
audit packet.

That certificate is now present:

- runner: [`scripts/lensing_deflection_h025_slope_fit_certificate.py`](../scripts/lensing_deflection_h025_slope_fit_certificate.py)
- cache: [`logs/runner-cache/lensing_deflection_h025_slope_fit_certificate.txt`](../logs/runner-cache/lensing_deflection_h025_slope_fit_certificate.txt)
- structured output:
  [`outputs/lensing_deflection_h025_slope_fit_certificate.json`](../outputs/lensing_deflection_h025_slope_fit_certificate.json)

The certificate runner reproduces the per-b H=0.25 cached values
(`kubo_true(b=3)=+5.986043`, `kubo_true(b=4)=+3.819639`, etc.) from
the checked-in single-b outputs and recomputes the log-log slope and
R² fit. It exits 0 with cached PASS rows for the H=0.25
b ∈ {3,4,5,6} slope/R² certificate.

This satisfies the audit-verdict repair target ("include the completed
H=0.25 b={3,4,5,6} outputs plus a runner that recomputes the log-log
slope and R² from them"). The certificate runner is already cited in
the artifact-chain section above; this audit-lane subsection records
the explicit alignment with the verdict's repair target. No claim
status is promoted: the bounded numerical-diagnostic scope of the
note is unchanged.
