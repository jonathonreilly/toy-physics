# Audit Ledger

**Generated:** 2026-04-27T02:31:54.688135+00:00
**Source of truth:** `data/audit_ledger.json`
**Schema:** see [README.md](README.md), [FRESH_LOOK_REQUIREMENTS.md](FRESH_LOOK_REQUIREMENTS.md), and [ALGEBRAIC_DECORATION_POLICY.md](ALGEBRAIC_DECORATION_POLICY.md).

This file is auto-generated. Do not edit by hand. Apply audits via `scripts/apply_audit.py`, then re-run `scripts/compute_effective_status.py` and `scripts/render_audit_ledger.py`.

## Reading rule

- **Bold** = audit-ratified (`retained`, `promoted`).
- _Italic_ = author-proposed but not yet audit-ratified (`proposed_retained`, `proposed_promoted`).
- ~~Strikethrough~~ = audit returned a failure verdict.
- Plain = `support`, `bounded`, `open`, or `unknown`.

Publication-facing tables MUST read `effective_status`, not `current_status`.

### Runner classification (static heuristic)

- runners classified: 679
- runners with (C) first-principles compute hits: 410
- runners with (D) external comparator hits: 173
- decoration candidates (no C, no D): 71

## Top 25 by load-bearing score (topology only)

Criticality and load-bearing score are computed from the citation graph alone. The audit lane intentionally does not use author-declared flagship status — that would let unratified framing drive audit cost on upstream support claims.

## Audit findings (full)

### `yt_ew_color_projection_theorem`

- **Note:** [`YT_EW_COLOR_PROJECTION_THEOREM.md`](../../docs/YT_EW_COLOR_PROJECTION_THEOREM.md)
- **current_status:** _proposed_retained_
- **audit_status:** ~~audited_conditional~~
- **effective_status:** ~~audited_conditional~~  (reason: `self`)
- **auditor:** `codex-audit-loop`  (codex-current; independence=cross_family)
- **load-bearing step:** The physical EW coupling (matched to the continuum where the SU(3) and EW sectors are factored) should use the connected color trace N_c(N_c^2-1)/N_c^2 = (N_c^2-1)/N_c.  _(class `F`)_
- **chain closes:** False — The source note gives the Fierz identity and shows CMT is color-blind, but it does not derive the physical lattice-to-continuum EW-current matching rule that selects the connected trace as the coupling readout.
- **rationale:** Issue: The failed step is the assertion that the physical EW coupling extraction should replace the total color trace N_c by the connected color trace N_c(N_c^2-1)/N_c^2; no one-hop retained theorem or registered runner derives that matching/readout rule, and the source note's R_conn input is stated as leading-order 1/N_c with O(1/N_c^4) corrections. Why this blocks: A proposed_retained universal 9/8 correction to physical EW couplings cannot follow from an asserted normalization convention or from a leading-order corrected quantity; the exact Fierz and CMT algebra leave the connected-trace value and the physical readout selection as independent premises. Repair target: Add a retained theorem deriving the lattice-to-continuum EW current matching from Cl(3)/Z^3 primitives, register the R_conn authority as a one-hop dependency if it remains load-bearing, and provide a runner that computes the connected two-vertex observable/matching factor rather than applying 8/9. Claim boundary until fixed: It is safe to claim that CMT alone cannot produce 9/8, that 8/9 is a motivated connected-color-trace/large-N_c matching ansatz with controlled corrections, and that applying it improves the quoted g_1 and g_2 numerics.
