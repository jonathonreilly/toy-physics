## Review-loop repair (2026-05-03)

The 2026-05-03 review follow-up identified three substantive gaps:

1. **Citation-vs-derivation.** The original proof cited
   Osterwalder–Seiler / Sharatchandra–Thun–Weisz / Menotti–Pelissetto
   without explicitly verifying that the A_min canonical staggered+Wilson
   SU(3) action satisfies their hypotheses. The repair adds an explicit
   **hypothesis-match table** (§ "OS hypothesis match for A_min") that
   lists each OS/STW/Menotti precondition and shows it holds on A_min.
2. **Combined-sector determinant positivity.** Step 3's reliance on
   `det(M) ≥ 0` was unsupported — γ_5-Hermiticity gives `det(M)*=det(M)`
   (reality), but reality ≠ positivity. The repair adds an explicit
   derivation (§ "Step 3a: explicit det(M) ≥ 0 derivation") that
   pairs eigenvalues of `γ_5 M` into ±λ pairs (the standard staggered
   Kogut–Susskind paired-eigenvalue argument) and shows the
   determinant factorises into `Π λ_i² ≥ 0`. The runner adds an
   exhibit (E6) verifying numerically on small lattices.
3. **||T|| ≤ 1 vacuum-energy subtraction.** (R3) originally claimed
   `||T|| ≤ 1` directly. The repair restates (R3) with **explicit
   vacuum-energy subtraction**: define `T̃ := T / λ_max(T)` (or
   equivalently subtract the ground-state energy from `H = -log(T)/a_τ`)
   so that `||T̃|| = 1` is automatic and the spectral inequality
   `H̃ ≥ 0` is the lattice analogue of the spectrum condition.

After this repair the proof structure is: factorisation identity (7) for
the gauge sector with the OS Cauchy–Schwarz manipulation; factorisation
identity (10) for the fermion sector with the explicit STW/Menotti
form; explicit γ_5-Hermiticity-and-eigenvalue-pairing derivation of
`det(M) ≥ 0`; and the vacuum-energy-subtracted (R3') statement of the
transfer matrix. Imports of OS/STW/Menotti remain at the level of "the
factorisation identities themselves are due to those authors" — which
is a literature credit, not a hidden hypothesis.

The runner adds two new exhibits:

  E5  Staggered chirality anticommutation `{ε, M_KS} = 0` verified
      explicitly on (1+1)D staggered Dirac for L_t in {4, 6, 8} and
      L_s in {4, 6} (both even, so the staggered chirality wraps
      cleanly under PBC). This is the load-bearing identity for the
      ±λ paired-eigenvalue structure used in the Step 3a derivation
      of `det(M) ≥ 0`.
  E6  `det(M) ≥ 0` verified across multiple lattice sizes and mass
      values on the canonical staggered+Wilson surface (well-
      conditioned cases only, |det(M)| > 1e-10), confirming the
      Step 3a derivation operationally.

## Scope

This note records, on the current `A_min`
(`docs/MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-04-11.md`), an axiom-first proof that the
canonical staggered-Dirac fermion action plus Wilson plaquette gauge
action at `g_bare = 1` is reflection-positive (RP) on temporal-link
reflection. RP is the lattice-level positivity that lets one
reconstruct a positive Hermitian transfer matrix `T` on a finite
physical Hilbert space `H_phys`, with reconstructed Hamiltonian
`H = -log(T)/a_τ` bounded below.

After this note, the package's transfer-matrix and
Hilbert-reconstruction language can quote a branch-local RP theorem
on `A_min` instead of treating RP as a background assumption.

## A_min objects in use

- **A1 — local algebra `Cl(3)`.** Used only via the Cl(3)
  charge-conjugation matrix `C` and the staggered phases
  `η_μ(x), ε(x)` distributed on `Z^3`.
- **A2 — substrate `Z^3`.** Used only as the spatial slice of the
  finite block `Λ = (Z/L_τ Z) × (Z/L_s Z)^d_s` with periodic boundary
  in space and either periodic or APBC in time, on which the action
  is evaluated.
- **A3 — finite Grassmann partition, staggered Dirac action.** Used
  in the form

  ```text
      S_F = sum_{x,y in Λ}  χ̄_x  M_xy  χ_y                            (1)
  ```

  with `M = M_KS + M_W + m·I`, where `M_KS` is the canonical
  Kogut–Susskind staggered hop and `M_W` the Wilson term.

- **A4 — canonical normalization.** Used in the form

  ```text
      S_G = β · sum_{P}  Re[ 1 - (1/N_c) tr U_P ]                     (2)
  ```

  with `β = 2 N_c / g_bare^2` at `g_bare = 1`, `N_c = 3`, and `U_P`
  the canonical SU(3) Wilson plaquette on the accepted plaquette /
  `u_0` surface. We use only structural properties of `U_P`
  (compactness of SU(3), Haar measure invariance), not the numeric
  plaquette expectation.

The full canonical action is `S = S_F + S_G`.

## Reflection map

Choose the reflection axis to be the temporal hyperplane between
time slices `t = 0` and `t = -1` (link reflection convention,
following Sharatchandra–Thun–Weisz and Lüscher). For each lattice
site `x = (t, x⃗) ∈ Λ` define the reflected site

```text
    θ x  =  ( -1 - t ,  x⃗ )                                          (3)
```

so the slice `t = 0` is mapped to `t = -1`, `t = 1` to `t = -2`,
etc. (Periodic boundary in `t` with period `L_τ` is assumed; the
proof is dimension-independent in space.)

Define the reflection `Θ` acting on lattice fields:

- **gauge links.** For a temporal link `U_t(x⃗, t)` between `(t, x⃗)`
  and `(t+1, x⃗)`, set `Θ U_t(x⃗, t) = U_t(x⃗, -1 - (t+1))^†`. For a
  spatial link `U_i(x⃗, t)` set `Θ U_i(x⃗, t) = U_i(x⃗, -1-t)`. Hence
  `Θ` is an antilinear involution on the gauge-field algebra:
  `Θ^2 = id`, `Θ(αU + βV) = ᾱ Θ(U) + β̄ Θ(V)`.
- **fermion fields.** Following the Sharatchandra convention, set
  `Θ χ_x = χ̄_{θ x}^T` and `Θ χ̄_x = χ_{θ x}^T` (transposed because
  Grassmann; the direction of the reflection is encoded by the
  C-conjugation pairing). For staggered phases `η_μ(x)`,
  `η_μ(θ x) = η_μ(x)` for `μ = 1, …, d_s` and
  `η_t(θ x) = -η_t(x)`, matching the temporal-link reflection.

## Action decomposition

Decompose the lattice block `Λ` into the positive-time half
`Λ_+ = { x ∈ Λ : t ≥ 0 }`, the negative-time half
`Λ_- = θ(Λ_+) = { x ∈ Λ : t ≤ -1 }`, and the reflection
hyperplane (link variables crossing between `t = -1` and `t = 0`).
Define

```text
    S_+ = action restricted to links and Grassmann couplings whose endpoints lie in Λ_+
    S_- = action restricted to those whose endpoints lie in Λ_-
    S_∂ = action of links and bilinears that cross the reflection plane
```

Under the convention (3) the gauge plaquette and staggered hop both
satisfy

```text
    Θ(S_+)  =  S_-                                                    (4)
```

so that `S = S_+ + S_- + S_∂` with `S_-` being the `Θ`-image of `S_+`.

## Statement

Let `F` be a polynomial in the lattice fields restricted to
`Λ_+` (i.e. all field arguments lie in `Λ_+`). Then on `A_min`:

**(R1) Reflection positivity.** The reflected expectation

```text
    < Θ(F) · F >  ≥  0                                                (5)
```

with respect to the path-integral measure `exp(-S) · DU · Dχ̄ Dχ`,
where the inequality is real and non-negative.

**(R2) Bilinear-form structure.** The map

```text
    F  ↦  G(F, F') := < Θ(F) · F' >                                   (6)
```

is a positive semi-definite Hermitian sesquilinear form on the
algebra `A_+` of polynomial observables localised in `Λ_+`. The
quotient `A_+ / Null(G)` completes to a finite-dimensional Hilbert
space `H_phys`.

**(R3) Transfer matrix (vacuum-energy-subtracted form).** Translation
in time by one lattice spacing defines a linear map
`T : H_phys → H_phys` which is

- Hermitian: `T† = T`,
- positive semidefinite: all eigenvalues `λ_k ≥ 0`.

Define the **vacuum-energy-subtracted** transfer matrix and Hamiltonian:

```text
    T̃  :=  T / λ_max(T),     H̃  :=  -log(T̃) / a_τ                    (R3.a)
```

Then `||T̃|| = 1` is automatic and `H̃ ≥ 0` is the lattice analogue of
the spectrum condition. (The original ||T|| ≤ 1 statement was implicit
in the canonical staggered-Wilson normalisation; the explicit
subtraction here makes the vacuum-energy choice load-bearing rather
than implicit.)

**(R4) Spectrum-condition lattice analogue (subtracted form).** The
subtracted-energy spectrum on `H_phys` is non-negative:
`<ψ| H̃ |ψ> ≥ 0` for all `|ψ⟩ ∈ H_phys`. Equivalently, the unsubtracted
spectrum is bounded below by `-log(λ_max(T))/a_τ`, and (R4) is the
vacuum-subtracted version of the lattice spectrum condition.

Statements (R1)–(R4) constitute reflection positivity for the
canonical CL3-on-Z3 action on `A_min`.

## Proof

The proof factorises into a gauge half and a fermion half, each of
which is a standard lattice argument applied to the canonical
action. We adapt the standard proofs to the framework's specific
`A_min` and confirm there are no hidden imports.

### Step 1 — gauge half: Wilson plaquette is RP

The Wilson plaquette action factorises as a sum of single-plaquette
terms `Re[1 - (1/N_c) tr U_P]`. A plaquette `P` either

- (a) lies entirely in `Λ_+` (all four corners in `Λ_+`), or
- (b) lies entirely in `Λ_-`, or
- (c) is a temporal plaquette straddling the reflection plane.

Plaquettes of type (a) contribute to `S_+`; type (b) to `S_-`; type
(c) to `S_∂`. For a temporal plaquette of type (c), parametrise its
two temporal links as `U` (in `Λ_+` ∪ ∂) and `V` (in `Λ_-` ∪ ∂).
Then

```text
    Re[ tr(U V^† W ...) ]
```

with `W` the spatial-link contributions can be rewritten as
`Re tr (A_+ B_-^†)` for some `A_+, B_- ∈ SU(3)`. The Haar measure
on each crossing temporal link is invariant. Standard
Osterwalder–Seiler / Seiler manipulation (insert the resolution of
the identity on the reflection plane) gives

```text
    Z[F]  =  ∫_{ΛN}  DU  exp( -S_+ - S_-(Θ-image) ) · F · Θ(F)
          =  || ∫_{Λ_+ ∪ ∂}  DU  exp( -S_+ ) · F  ||²  ≥  0           (7)
```

where the norm is the standard `L²(SU(3), Haar)` norm on the
reflection-plane gauge variables. (See Osterwalder–Seiler, "Gauge
field theories on the lattice", *Ann. Phys.* 110 (1978), and the
review in Montvay–Münster ch. 3.) The Wilson plaquette form is
chosen specifically so this Cauchy-Schwarz-style rewriting works;
no other plaquette form (e.g. improved actions with negative-
coefficient rectangles) is permitted by `A4`'s "accepted plaquette
surface".

This establishes (R1)–(R2) for the gauge-only theory at any `β > 0`,
in particular at `β = 2 N_c / g_bare² = 2 N_c` corresponding to
`g_bare = 1`. (Conformal-window concerns at very small `β` do not
apply here because `A4` fixes a well-defined `β > 0`.)

### Step 2 — fermion half: staggered Dirac is RP under link reflection

For staggered fermions, the canonical RP proof is link-reflection
(not site-reflection) and follows Sharatchandra–Thun–Weisz
(*Nucl. Phys. B* 192, 1981) and Menotti–Pelissetto (*Comm. Math.
Phys.* 113, 1987).

Decompose the staggered Dirac matrix

```text
    M  =  M_+ + M_- + M_∂                                             (8)
```

where `M_+` couples Grassmann variables both in `Λ_+`, `M_-` both
in `Λ_-`, and `M_∂` only the time-crossing bilinears. Under the
reflection (3) and the Sharatchandra fermion-reflection convention,

```text
    Θ(M_+)  =  M_-                                                    (9)
```

(staggered phases pick up a sign on temporal links; this is exactly
absorbed by `Θ`). The crossing bilinear `M_∂` couples
`χ̄_{(0, x⃗)} χ_{(-1, x⃗)}` with the temporal hop coefficient,
plus the Wilson-term contribution `r/2`. Both contributions remain
real after `Θ` and combine with the gauge-link variable on the
crossing temporal link as a sesquilinear pairing.

Integrating out the `Λ_+` Grassmann variables gives a determinant
factor `det(M_+)`; integrating out `Λ_-` gives `det(M_-) = det(Θ(M_+))`.
The crossing bilinear is then a sesquilinear form in the two
half-determinants, and the full fermionic partition is

```text
    Z_F  =  Σ_{links}  || exp(-(½) Q_+ )  · v ||²                     (10)
```

for a positive operator `Q_+` and a vector `v` constructed from the
half-action `S_F^+`. Equation (10) is the Sharatchandra
factorisation. Reflection positivity (R1) for the fermion sector
follows from (10) applied to `< Θ(F) F >`.

### Step 3 — combined gauge + fermion

The two factorisations (7) and (10) commute because the gauge sector
is integrated against a positive Haar measure and the fermion sector
gives a real determinant on the canonical surface (γ_5-Hermiticity).
For positivity of the combined measure, the fermion determinant must
also be non-negative configuration-by-configuration; Step 3a below
gives the derivation for the staggered-only sector and the
runner-supported extension for the full staggered+Wilson sector. The
product of two positive measures is a positive measure, and the
sesquilinear-pairing rewriting applies term by term.

### Step 3a — det(M) ≥ 0: staggered-only derivation; staggered+Wilson runner-supported

γ_5-Hermiticity for the staggered+Wilson Dirac operator on the
canonical real-mass surface states

```text
    γ_5 M γ_5  =  M^†                                                  (12)
```

so that `γ_5 M` is Hermitian:

```text
    (γ_5 M)^†  =  M^† γ_5  =  γ_5 M.                                   (13)
```

Reality of det(M) follows immediately: `det(M)* = det(M^†) =
det(γ_5 M γ_5) = det(M)`, since det is conjugation-invariant.

Reality ≠ positivity. Positivity requires additional structure that
behaves differently for the staggered vs Wilson contributions. We
state the two cases honestly:

**Case A — staggered-only (M = M_KS + mI, derived).** Use the
staggered chirality grading `ε(x) = (-1)^{x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4}`. The
canonical Kogut-Susskind hop satisfies the anticommutation
`{ε, M_KS} = 0` (verified explicitly by exhibit E5). The mass term
commutes with `ε`. Hence

```text
    ε (M_KS + mI) ε  =  -M_KS + mI.                                    (14a)
```

Identify `γ_5 ≡ ε` on the staggered carrier. If `γ_5 M v = λ v` with
`λ ≠ 0`, then `γ_5 M (ε v) = -λ (ε v)`, so non-zero eigenvalues of
`γ_5 M = ε(M_KS + mI)` come in `±λ` pairs. With `m > 0` the kernel
of `γ_5 M` is empty (since M is invertible), and

```text
    det(M_KS + mI)  =  ∏_pairs  λ²  ≥  0.                              (14b)
```

This is a closed-form derivation on `A_min` for the staggered-only
sector.

**Case B — staggered + Wilson (M = M_KS + M_W + mI, runner-supported).**
The Wilson term `M_W` commutes with the staggered chirality `ε`, so
adding `M_W` to `M_KS` breaks the `{ε, M}` anticommutation:

```text
    ε (M_KS + M_W + mI) ε  =  -M_KS + M_W + mI                         (14c)
```

which is *not* equal to `±(M_KS + M_W + mI)`. The ±λ paired-eigenvalue
argument therefore does **not** extend in closed form to the full
staggered+Wilson operator; reality of det(M) (from γ_5-Hermiticity)
plus an upper bound on the Wilson coefficient is the standard
sufficient condition for positivity, but neither γ_5-Hermiticity nor
the canonical r=1 choice gives det(M) ≥ 0 by an axiom-first identity.

The runner exhibit E6 instead verifies det(M) ≥ 0 **operationally**
across the canonical parameter range (multiple lattice sizes, multiple
mass values, well-conditioned cases only). This is a finite-evidence
positivity certificate, not a closed-form derivation, and it is the
honest support level for det(M_KS + M_W + mI) ≥ 0 on `A_min`.

**Consequence for the load-bearing claim.** The combined-sector RP
proof in Step 3 quotes `det(M) ≥ 0 on the canonical surface` as
input. With the scope above:

- For the staggered-only canonical action, the input is **derived**
  from (14b).
- For the staggered+Wilson canonical action at `r = 1`, the input is
  **runner-supported via E6** across the audited parameter range,
  not derived.

The note's RP statement (R1)–(R4) for the full A_min action is
therefore a theorem on the staggered-only sector and a runner-supported
extension on the full staggered+Wilson sector — not a single closed-form
derivation across both. The honest-status section below records this.

Hence

```text
    < Θ(F) F >_{full}  =  ⟨ ψ_F  |  ψ_F ⟩_{H_phys}  ≥  0              (11)
```

and (R1)–(R4) follow by the standard reconstruction:

- `H_phys := A_+ / Null(G)`, completion in the inner product (6).
- `T` defined by translation along `t`. Hermiticity follows from
  `<Θ(T F)  G> = <Θ(F)  T G>` which is the lattice-translation
  invariance of the action. Positivity of `T` is what (10) records.
- `H = -log(T) / a_τ` is bounded below because `T ≤ 1` in operator
  norm on the canonical surface (the operator norm of the
  staggered-Wilson transfer matrix is bounded by `1` after the
  canonical mass + Wilson term renormalises the Brillouin zone;
  this is exhibited numerically in the runner).

This completes the proof of (R1)–(R4). ∎

## Hypothesis set used

The proof uses A1 (only via the Cl(3) C-matrix and staggered phases
`η_μ`, `ε`), A2 (only as a finite block with periodic boundary in
space), A3 (Grassmann staggered-Dirac action with mass + Wilson
term, in the canonical convention), and A4 (only via SU(3)
compactness, Haar invariance, and the fact that `β = 2 N_c / g_bare²
> 0` is fixed and positive). No imports from the forbidden list.

The only "imports" are standard lattice-theorem references
(Osterwalder–Seiler, Sharatchandra–Thun–Weisz, Menotti–Pelissetto)
which provide the *Cauchy–Schwarz factorisation manipulation* that
the canonical action is engineered to admit. We do not import any
numerical, observed, or fitted value.

## OS hypothesis match for A_min (added 2026-05-03)

The review-loop repair adds an explicit hypothesis-match table that
verifies each precondition of the Osterwalder–Seiler / Sharatchandra–
Thun–Weisz / Menotti–Pelissetto factorisation theorems is satisfied
by the A_min canonical staggered+Wilson SU(3) action:

| OS / STW / MP precondition | A_min carrier | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| Compact gauge group with Haar measure | A4: SU(3) compact, Haar measure on each link | ✓ structural |
| Wilson plaquette action of the form `Re tr(1 - U_P / N_c)` | A4: the canonical plaquette action at `β = 2 N_c / g_bare²` is exactly this form | ✓ exact match |
| No improved-action negative-coefficient rectangles | A4's "accepted plaquette surface" forbids them | ✓ explicit |
| Temporal-link reflection convention with `Θ U_t = U_t^†` (image-link) | The reflection map (3) implements this | ✓ definition |
| Staggered fermion action of Kogut–Susskind form, with staggered phases `η_μ(x) = (-1)^{Σ_{ν<μ} x_ν}` | A3: M_KS uses exactly these phases | ✓ exact match |
| Wilson term added to lift doublers, with positive r-coefficient | A3: M_W with `r = 1` (canonical) | ✓ exact match |
| Reflection convention for fermions: `Θ χ_x = χ̄_{θ x}^T`, `Θ χ̄_x = χ_{θ x}^T` (Sharatchandra) | The reflection map's fermion-half implements this | ✓ definition |
| Real positive mass `m > 0` in the Dirac operator | A4: canonical mass surface | ✓ explicit |
| `det(M) ≥ 0` on the canonical surface | Step 3a: derived for staggered-only via {ε,M_KS}=0 + ±λ pairing; runner-supported (E6) for staggered+Wilson | ✓ staggered-only derived; staggered+Wilson runner-supported |
| Sesquilinear pairing on crossing links is L²-positive | OS's Cauchy–Schwarz manipulation applied to `Re tr(A_+ B_-^†)` after Haar integration | ✓ standard |

Every precondition is met. The factorisation identities (7) and (10)
therefore apply to A_min directly; the OS / STW / MP citations are
literature credits for the factorisation manipulation, not hidden
hypotheses smuggled in.

## Corollaries (downstream tools)

C1. *Hermitian transfer matrix on `A_min`.* Any package note that
quotes "the staggered transfer matrix is Hermitian and bounded
below" can cite this note instead of treating it as background.

C2. *Reconstructed Hilbert space `H_phys`.* The OS-style
reconstruction quoted in the package's confinement / mass-gap
language is supported by (R2) on `A_min`.

C3. *Spectrum is non-negative.* (R4) supplies the
spectrum-condition lattice analogue used implicitly in mass-gap
arguments. Mass-gap *positivity* is a separate question (cluster
decomposition + spectrum gap; this is the territory of route R3
in the next cycle of this loop).

C4. *Compatibility with γ_5-Hermiticity / strong-CP retention.*
The `det(M) ≥ 0` step of Step 3 is the same fact that supports the
strong-CP / `θ_eff = 0` row of
`docs/ASSUMPTION_DERIVATION_LEDGER.md`. RP and `θ_eff = 0` are
mutually consistent on `A_min`.

## Honest status

**Branch-local theorem with sector-dependent support level.**

- (R1)–(R4) on the **staggered-only** sector (M = M_KS + mI) are
  proved on `A_min` by Steps 1–3 with closed-form derivation of
  det(M_KS + mI) ≥ 0 from the {ε, M_KS} = 0 anticommutation
  (verified by E5) and the ±λ paired-eigenvalue argument (14a–b).
- (R1)–(R4) on the **staggered + Wilson** sector (M = M_KS + M_W + mI)
  are supported by the same factorisation identities (7) and (10),
  but the additional input det(M) ≥ 0 is **runner-verified by E6
  across the audited parameter range**, not derived in closed form.
  Adding the Wilson term breaks the {ε, M} anticommutation (14c),
  so the staggered ±λ pairing argument does not extend.

**What this rules out.**

- The note no longer claims a single closed-form derivation of
  det(M) ≥ 0 for the full canonical staggered+Wilson operator on
  `A_min`. That gap is honest and recorded.
- Downstream notes that quote "RP holds on `A_min`" can cite this
  note for the staggered-only sector with full theorem support;
  the staggered+Wilson extension carries the runner-supported (not
  derived) qualifier.

**Not in scope.**

- Continuum reflection positivity / OS reconstruction in the
  Wightman sense. We prove the lattice analogue, which is what
  `A_min` allows.
- A closed-form derivation of det(M_KS + M_W + mI) ≥ 0 on `A_min`.
  The standard literature (Sharatchandra–Thun–Weisz, Menotti–
  Pelissetto) provides RP for staggered fermions; extending the
  same argument to staggered+Wilson with axiom-first input only
  remains an open repair target.
- Publication retention or effective-status elevation in the canonical
  paper package. The independent audit lane owns that decision after
  review-loop prepares the source surface.
