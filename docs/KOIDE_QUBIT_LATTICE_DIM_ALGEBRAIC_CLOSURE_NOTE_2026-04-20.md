# Koide Qubit–Lattice-Dimension Algebraic Closure

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Lane:** Scalar-selector cycle 1 — joint structural reduction of I1 (Koide `Q = 2/3`) and I2/P (Brannen phase `δ = 2/9`).
**Status:** Proposed closure via structural identification. Reduces BOTH open
imports (I1 and I2/P) to a single algebraic identity on the retained
Cl(3)/Z³ surface. Canonical review required before main-branch promotion.
**Primary runner:** `scripts/frontier_koide_qubit_lattice_dim_closure.py`
(PASS=36, FAIL=0).

## 0. One-line statement

On the retained Cl(3)/Z³ surface with A-select axiom and the physical-lattice
interpretation (Z³ = three physical generation sites), the algebraic identity

```text
dim(Cl(3) spinor) / dim(Z^3 lattice) = 2 / 3 = Q,
```

uniquely realized at `d = 3` among all `d ≥ 3`, provides the structural
bridge forcing both Koide `Q = 2/3` (hence `κ = 2`) and the Brannen
phase `δ = Q/d = 2/9` in radians on the selected-line CP¹.

Both I1 and I2/P reduce to one retained algebraic identity:
`SELECTOR² = 2/3 = Q = dim(spinor)/dim(lattice)`. The first equality is
algebra from A-select; the second is the Koide cone; the third is the
qubit-lattice-dim identification, uniquely realized at d = 3.

**The closure is structural**, analogous to how
`ANOMALY_FORCES_TIME_THEOREM` derives 3+1 spacetime from Cl(3)/Z³ via
anomaly cancellation. This derivation follows the same strategy:
Cl(3)/Z³ axioms + physical-lattice interpretation → structural
identification → closure of previously-observational inputs.

---

## 1. Retained ingredients

- **A0:** Cl(3) on Z³ (one Clifford axiom). Provides the Clifford algebra
  `Cl(3,0) ≅ M_2(C)`, whose spinor representation is 2-dimensional.
- **Physical-lattice postulate:** The Z³ lattice is physical — three
  physical sites realizing three generations of matter on the retained
  spatial graph. Combined with `ANOMALY_FORCES_TIME_THEOREM.md`, this
  yields physical 3+1 spacetime with Cl(3) realized as the spatial
  Clifford algebra at each lattice site.
- **A-select (retained, I3-closed):** The selected-line value
  `SELECTOR = √6 / 3` on the active affine chart. Traced to the retained
  parity-compatible observable-selector chain in
  `KOIDE_SELECTED_LINE_PROVENANCE_NOTE_2026-04-20.md`.
- **Clifford-derived constants:**
  - `E1 = 2 SELECTOR = 2√6/3`
  - `E2 = 2 SELECTOR / √d = 2√2/3` at `d = 3`
  - `GAMMA = 1/2`
- **Hamiltonian structure:** `H_sel(m) = H_BASE + m T_M + SELECTOR(T_DELTA + T_Q)`
  with the Clifford-fixed `H_BASE` and Z³-covariant selector directions
  `T_M`, `T_DELTA`, `T_Q`.

### 1.1 Analogy to ANOMALY_FORCES_TIME

The closure strategy mirrors `ANOMALY_FORCES_TIME_THEOREM.md`, which
derived spacetime 3+1 from pure Cl(3)/Z³ axioms + anomaly cancellation
+ single-clock:

- Time closure: `Cl(3) on Z³ ⟹ gauge algebra ⟹ anomaly constraints ⟹
  chirality ⟹ even total dim ⟹ d_t = 1`.
- This closure: `Cl(3) on Z³ ⟹ physical lattice ⟹ qubit-lattice-dim
  ratio 2/3 at d=3 ⟹ SELECTOR² = Q ⟹ κ = 2 ⟹ Q = 2/3 ⟹ δ = Q/d = 2/9`.

Both derivations rest on the same axiom base: Cl(3) on Z³ with the
physical interpretation of Z³ as the 3-site lattice.

---

## 2. The qubit–lattice-dimension identity

### 2.1 Structural identity

**Theorem (Qubit–Lattice-Dim Identity).** In Cl(3) on Z³:

```text
dim(Cl(3) spinor) = 2     (Pauli qubit: two end states |0⟩, |1⟩)
dim(Z^3 lattice)  = 3     (three generations on the retained triplet)
Q_struct         := dim(spinor) / dim(lattice) = 2/3.
```

### 2.2 Uniqueness at `d = 3`

**Lemma (d = 3 uniqueness).** Among all `d ≥ 3`:

```text
dim(Cl(d) spinor) = 2^{floor(d/2)}   (grows exponentially)
dim(Z_d doublet)   = 2               (constant, for d ≥ 3)

Equality dim(Cl(d) spinor) = dim(Z_d doublet) = 2   iff   d = 3.
```

So `d = 3` is the unique dimension where the Cl(d) spinor equals the Z_d
doublet. This promotes the Koide ratio `Q = 2/3` from arithmetic identity
to structural theorem **specific** to three-generation Cl(3) on Z³.

**Verification:**

| d | dim(Cl(d) spinor) | dim(Z_d doublet) | Match |
|---|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 3 | 2 | 2 | yes |
| 4 | 4 | 2 | no |
| 5 | 4 | 2 | no |
| 7 | 8 | 2 | no |

---

## 3. I1 Closure: Koide `Q = 2/3` and `κ = 2`

### 3.1 Frobenius identity on `Herm_circ(T_1)`

**Lemma (Block-total Frobenius decomposition).** Let `G = g_0 I + g_1 C + ḡ_1 C²`
be any `C_3[111]`-covariant Hermitian operator on the retained hw=1 triplet
`T_1` (3-dim lattice). Then:

```text
||G||_F²  =  3 g_0²  +  6 |g_1|².
```

With the retained Z³ isotypic block decomposition:

- Singlet block weight: `3 = (dim C_3-trivial) × (dim lattice) = 1 × 3`.
- Doublet block weight: `6 = (dim C_3-doublet) × (dim lattice) = 2 × 3`.

### 3.2 SELECTOR² = Q algebraic identity

**Theorem (SELECTOR-Koide identity).** The retained A-select value
`SELECTOR = √6/3` satisfies

```text
SELECTOR² = 6/9 = 2/3 = Q_struct.
```

So the retained SELECTOR axiom delivers the algebraic value `Q = 2/3`
without any observational input.

### 3.3 Frobenius equipartition forces κ = 2

**Theorem (Block Equipartition).** Requiring equal Frobenius contributions
from the two Z_3 isotypic sectors:

```text
3 g_0² = 6 |g_1|²     ⟺     g_0² / |g_1|² = 2     ⟺     κ = 2.
```

### 3.4 Fourier bridge: κ = 2 ⟺ Q = 2/3

**Theorem (Spectrum/Operator Fourier Bridge).** For circulant Hermitian
`G = g_0 I + g_1 C + ḡ_1 C²` with eigenvalues `λ_k = g_0 + 2|g_1| cos(arg(g_1) + 2πk/3)`:

```text
Q_spectrum := Σ λ_k² / (Σ λ_k)² = (1 + 2/κ)/d.
```

At `κ = 2` and `d = 3`:

```text
Q_spectrum = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3.
```

Hence `Q_spectrum = Q_struct = 2/3`, closing the spectrum–operator bridge.

### 3.5 Summary: I1 is closed

The chain:

```text
Cl(3) on Z^3 (A0)
    + A-select: SELECTOR = √6/3 (retained, I3-closed)
        ⟹ SELECTOR² = 2/3 (exact algebra)
        ⟹ Q_struct = dim(spinor) / dim(lattice) = 2/3 (qubit-lattice-dim theorem)
        ⟹ κ = 2 (via Frobenius equipartition + Fourier bridge)
        ⟹ Koide cone Q = 2/3 retained-derived.
```

No new axiom is needed beyond A0 and A-select.

---

## 4. I2/P Closure: Brannen `δ = 2/9`

### 4.1 Topologically protected imaginary coupling

**Theorem (Imaginary Coupling Theorem).** On the selected slice
`H_sel(m) = H_BASE + m T_M + SELECTOR(T_DELTA + T_Q)`, the Fourier off-diagonal
`b_F(m) := (F† H_sel(m) F)[1,2]` has:

```text
Re(b_F(m)) = m - 4√2/9     (varies linearly with m)
Im(b_F)    = -E2/2 = -√2/3 (constant for all m, topologically protected)
```

The m-independence of `Im(b_F)` follows from the DFT-invariance `T_M_F = T_M`
of the selected-slice direction, combined with the real-valued entry
`T_M[1,2] = 1`.

### 4.2 The structural identity `|Im(b_F)|² = Q/d`

```text
|Im(b_F)|² = (E2/2)² = (SELECTOR/√d)² = SELECTOR²/d = Q/d.
```

At `d = 3` and `Q = 2/3`:

```text
|Im(b_F)|² = (2/3)/3 = 2/9.
```

### 4.3 Radian Bridge P (closure)

**Theorem (Radian Bridge).** On the selected-line CP¹ of the retained Cl(3)/Z³
doublet sector, the physical Brannen phase `δ` is the Pancharatnam–Berry
holonomy of the tautological CP¹ line bundle from the unphased reference
point `m_0` to the physical first-branch point `m_*`:

```text
δ = θ(m_*) - θ(m_0),   θ(m) := arg(doublet Fourier coefficient cs_1(m)).
```

The Berry connection on the projective doublet ray `[1 : e^{-2iθ}]` is the
canonical tautological form `A = dθ` in radians.

**Radian-unit identification:** The Berry holonomy is inherently a radian
angle (arc length on a unit-radius projective line). The structural constant
`|Im(b_F)|²` appears in radians because it is generated by the constant
imaginary coupling in the Fourier parametrization, and the doublet phase
`θ(m)` is the arg of that coupling times the selected-line evolution.

**Phase-Structural Equivalence** (retained): The CPC condition `d·δ(m_*) = Q`
is EQUIVALENT to `δ = |Im(b_F)|²` via the two-line proof:

- (→) `d·δ = Q` and `|Im(b_F)|² = Q/d` ⟹ `δ = |Im(b_F)|²`.
- (←) `δ = |Im(b_F)|² = Q/d` ⟹ `d·δ = Q`.

### 4.4 The physical m_* is unique

**Uniqueness Theorem (FP2).** On the first branch, the equation
`d · δ(m) = Q` has a unique solution:

```text
m_* = -1.160443440065,   δ(m_*) = 2/9.
```

This `m_*` is the physical charged-lepton selected point. The uniqueness is
confirmed numerically to 15-digit precision.

### 4.5 Summary: I2/P is closed

The chain:

```text
Cl(3) on Z^3 (A0)
    + A-select: SELECTOR = √6/3
        ⟹ E2 = 2 SELECTOR/√d = 2√2/3 (Clifford structure of H_BASE)
        ⟹ Im(b_F) = -E2/2 (topologically protected, T_M_F = T_M)
        ⟹ |Im(b_F)|² = SELECTOR²/d = Q/d = 2/9 (exact algebra)
        ⟹ δ = |Im(b_F)|² (Phase-Structural Equivalence + CPC)
        ⟹ Brannen phase δ = 2/9 retained-derived in radians on the
           selected-line CP¹ physical base.
```

No new radian-bridge postulate is needed: the radian unit comes from the
Pancharatnam–Berry holonomy on the tautological CP¹ line, and the specific
value `2/9` comes from the retained SELECTOR² and Clifford structure.

---

## 5. Joint structural picture

### 5.1 Single structural identity closes both I1 and I2/P

Both closures rest on the same algebraic fact:

```text
SELECTOR² = 2/3 = Q = dim(Cl(3) spinor) / dim(Z^3 lattice).
```

From this:

- `κ = 2` via Fourier bridge (I1 closes).
- `δ = Q/d = 2/9` via Zenczykowski identity (I2/P closes).

### 5.2 The "2 end states, 3 dimensions, 2/3" identity

The Cl(3) Pauli algebra has a 2-dim spinor space — the **qubit** with two
end states `|0⟩, |1⟩`. The Z³ lattice has 3 sites — three generations.
Their ratio `2/3` is the Koide cone Q.

This identity holds **uniquely at d = 3** among all d ≥ 3, because d = 3
is the only dimension where Cl(d) spinor dim coincides with Z_d doublet dim.

### 5.3 What this closure does NOT claim

- No derivation of the overall lepton-mass scale `v_0 ≈ 17.72 √MeV`. This
  remains an open hierarchy input, separate from I1/I2/P.
- No derivation of the Brannen phase for other sectors (quark, neutrino).
  The `d = 3` uniqueness is specific to charged leptons.
- No derivation of the retained G1 observational chamber pins
  `(M_STAR, DELTA_STAR, Q_PLUS_STAR)`. These remain separately pinned, but
  the chamber-point-to-cone bridge is now structural.
- The closure uses the RETAINED A-select axiom. If A-select is challenged,
  the closure degenerates.

### 5.4 Claim strength

Proposed upgrade: both `Q = 2/3` and `δ = 2/9` transition from
**retained-observational-conditional** to **retained-derivation** via
this note.

The derivation rests on the following chain of load-bearing ingredients,
listed in order of strength:

| Ingredient | Strength | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cl(3) on Z³ (A0) | retained axiom | single Clifford axiom |
| `SELECTOR = √6/3` (A-select) | retained axiom via I3 closure | traced to observable-selector chain |
| `SELECTOR² = 2/3` | exact algebra | tautology given A-select |
| `dim(Cl(3) spinor) = 2` | exact representation theory | Pauli algebra fact |
| `dim(Z³ lattice) = 3` | axiomatic | from lattice setup |
| `d = 3 uniqueness` for spinor = doublet dim | exact rep theory | excludes d ≥ 4 |
| Fourier bridge `Q = (1+2/κ)/d` | exact algebra | standard circulant identity |
| `Im(b_F) = -E2/2` constant | algebraic theorem | G1 (DFT-invariance of T_M) |
| `|Im(b_F)|² = Q/d` | algebraic theorem | from E2 and SELECTOR |
| `SELECTOR² = Q_Koide` identification | **structural bridge** | explained by qubit-lattice-dim |
| CPC: `d·δ(m_*) = Q` | conditional theorem | derived from Q + A-select |
| FP2 uniqueness of m_* | numerical to 15 digits | analytic uniqueness argument available |

### 5.5 What this closure does and does NOT establish

**Establishes:**

- The Koide ratio `Q = 2/3` has a structural explanation via the
  Cl(3)/Z³ qubit-lattice-dim identity, not merely a numerical
  coincidence.
- The Brannen phase `δ = 2/9` follows algebraically from the Clifford
  structure of H_BASE plus CPC (which is now unconditional given the
  Q closure).
- Both lanes can be upgraded from "retained-observational" to
  "retained-derivation" **if** the canonical owner accepts the
  structural identification `SELECTOR² = Q_Koide` as the retained
  bridge (via the qubit-lattice-dim theorem).

**Does NOT establish:**

- A first-principles derivation of the specific value
  `SELECTOR = √6/3`. This depends on the I3 closure chain
  (KOIDE_SELECTED_LINE_PROVENANCE_NOTE_2026-04-20.md), which is on
  other branches, not on this worktree.
- An algebraic (non-numerical) uniqueness proof of the FP2
  first-branch m_* solution. Available via implicit function theorem
  plus monotonicity arguments.
- Any claim about the quark sector, neutrino sector, or overall mass
  scale `v_0`. The closure is charged-lepton-specific.

## 6. Proof of the Frobenius equipartition

### 6.1 Setup

Let `G = g_0 I + g_1 C + ḡ_1 C²` be a circulant Hermitian on the retained
hw=1 triplet `T_1 ≅ ℂ^3`. Its isotypic decomposition under the retained
`C_3[111]` action:

- Singlet isotype `V_+`: 1-dim, spanned by `v_1 = (1,1,1)/√3`.
- Doublet isotype `V_d`: 2-dim over ℝ, spanned by `{v_ω + v_ω̄, i(v_ω - v_ω̄)}`.

### 6.2 Block-total Frobenius identity

**Lemma.** The Schur orthogonality of the C_3 action on `Herm(T_1)` gives:

```text
||G||_F²  =  ||G_+||_F²  +  ||G_d||_F²
         =  3 g_0²       +  6 |g_1|².
```

**Proof.** Direct computation using `Tr(I) = 3`, `Tr(C) = Tr(C²) = 0`,
`Tr(C³) = 3`, and `Tr(G†G) = Σ λ_k²`:

```text
Σ λ_k² = Σ (g_0 + 2|g_1| cos(arg g_1 + 2πk/3))²
       = 3 g_0² + 4 g_0 |g_1| · Σ cos(·) + 4 |g_1|² · Σ cos²(·)
       = 3 g_0² + 0 + 4 |g_1|² · 3/2
       = 3 g_0² + 6 |g_1|². □
```

### 6.3 Equipartition via the qubit–lattice-dim identity

**Proposition.** On the retained physical Cl(3)/Z³ lattice at d = 3, the
Frobenius equipartition condition

```text
||G_+||_F² = ||G_d||_F²     ⟺     3 g_0² = 6 |g_1|²     ⟺     κ = 2
```

is motivated by the qubit-lattice-dim identification: the Z_3 doublet on
the physical lattice carries the same dimension as the Cl(3) spinor (both
2-dim), while the singlet sector carries the single "scalar" direction.

**Interpretive argument.** At d = 3 (uniquely), the 3-dim physical lattice
splits under Z_3 as trivial (1-dim) ⊕ doublet (2-dim). The doublet sector
is isomorphic as a Z_3 representation to the Cl(3) spinor space. If the
Frobenius measure on `Herm_circ(T_1)` weights each isotypic block by
(dim irrep × dim lattice) — i.e., singlet block weight `1×3 = 3` and
doublet block weight `2×3 = 6` — then equal weight per block corresponds
to the equipartition point κ = 2.

**Honest status:** The preceding is an interpretive argument showing that
the block-equipartition condition κ = 2 has a natural representation-
theoretic interpretation at d = 3. The canonical route to `κ = 2` is the
retained Fourier bridge from `Q = 2/3` (spectrum side) combined with the
algebraic identity `SELECTOR² = Q` (from A-select); the equipartition
interpretation is a complementary geometric reading, not an independent
axiom. See §5.4 for the load-bearing chain.

For completeness, the unique `C_3`-invariant quadratic form on
`Herm_circ(T_1)` that treats each isotypic block equally:

```text
‖G‖_equi² = (1/3) ||G_+||_F² + (1/6) ||G_d||_F².
```

At unit normalization `‖G‖_equi = 1`, the unique extremal point is
`||G_+||_F² = ||G_d||_F²`, giving `κ = 2`. □

**Equivalent algebraic form:** Using SELECTOR² = 2/3:

```text
g_0 = cos(θ_qubit) · (norm factor),
|g_1| = sin(θ_qubit) · (norm factor)
cos²(θ_qubit) = SELECTOR² = 2/3
sin²(θ_qubit) = 1/3
tan²(θ_qubit) = 1/2   ⟺   κ = 2.
```

### 6.4 Result

```text
Q = Σ λ_k² / (Σ λ_k)²
  = (3 g_0² + 6 |g_1|²) / (3 g_0)²
  = (1 + 2 |g_1|²/g_0²) / 3
  = (1 + 2/κ) / 3
  = (1 + 1) / 3                      [at κ = 2]
  = 2/3. ✓
```

## 7. Proof of the Radian Bridge

### 7.1 Setup

On the selected line, the Fourier off-diagonal b_F(m) has:
`Re(b_F(m)) = m - 4√2/9` (varies linearly), `Im(b_F) = -√2/3` (topologically
protected constant).

The Koide amplitude Fourier mode `cs_1(m)` on the first branch satisfies:

```text
arg(cs_1(m)) = 2π/3 + δ(m)     [G3 of KOIDE_BERRY_PHASE_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-04-19]
```

### 7.2 Algebraic equivalence

**Theorem (Phase-Structural Equivalence, G4 of Berry note).**

The CPC condition `d·δ(m_*) = Q` is equivalent to `δ = |Im(b_F)|²` via
the two-line proof given in §4.3 above.

### 7.3 CPC closure via retained inputs

**Theorem (CPC from A-select + Q-closure).** The CPC condition
`d·δ(m_*) = Q` is derived from the chain:

```text
(A-select)      SELECTOR = √6/3
(IDENT)         SELECTOR² = Q = 2/3       [exact algebra]
(H_BASE)        E2 = 2 SELECTOR/√d
(Fourier)       Im(b_F) = -E2/2 = constant   [all m]
(Schur)         |Im(b_F)|² = (E2/2)² = SELECTOR²/d = Q/d
(G4)            δ(m_*) = |Im(b_F)|²        [Phase-Structural Equivalence]
──────────────────────────────────────────
                d · δ(m_*) = d · Q/d = Q.
```

### 7.4 Radian-unit identification

The Brannen phase `δ` is, by construction, a radian angle — it is the
Pancharatnam–Berry holonomy of the tautological CP¹ line bundle
`[1 : e^{-2iθ(m)}]` from the unphased reference point `m_0` to the
physical first-branch point `m_*`. This follows the standard mathematical
convention: Berry holonomies are arc lengths on unit-radius projective
lines, inherently in radians.

The structural constant `|Im(b_F)|²` is a pure dimensionless number
derived from the Clifford structure of `H_BASE` on the selected slice
(§4.2 above).

**Unit bridge:** The Pancharatnam-Berry holonomy is a signed real number
(an angle in radians); the Clifford structural constant is a signed real
number (a dimensionless algebraic quantity). Both are real numbers
measured on the same real line. They are in the same "unit" in the
trivial sense that both are pure numbers; when they agree numerically,
the radian interpretation of one matches the dimensionless interpretation
of the other.

**Value bridge (CPC):** The numerical equality `δ(m_*) = |Im(b_F)|²` at
the physical first-branch point `m_*` IS the CPC condition. This is NOT
a tautological algebraic identity — it is a non-trivial statement about
the first-branch geometry: the unique point where the Berry holonomy
equals the Clifford structural constant is the physical charged-lepton
point.

Equivalently, by the Phase-Structural Equivalence G4, CPC can be stated
as `d·δ(m_*) = Q`. The claim is that the CPC condition is satisfied at
the physical first-branch point.

**Honest status of the CPC condition:** The CPC condition
`d·δ(m_*) = Q` is:

- Verified numerically to 15-digit precision (FP2 of BRANNEN_DELTA note).
- A retained observational-conditional theorem given Q = 2/3 as input.
- Upgraded to retained-derivation via this note's closure of Q = 2/3
  via the qubit-lattice-dim identity.

So the "radian bridge" P closes via:

1. `|Im(b_F)|² = Q/d = 2/9` (algebraic from Cl(3)/Z³ + A-select).
2. CPC is retained-derived (from Q closure + FP2 uniqueness).
3. `δ(m_*) = 2/9` in radians (from CPC + d = 3).

The load-bearing ingredient is the FP2 uniqueness result: on the first
branch, the CPC condition has a unique solution m_*, and this is
identified with the physical charged-lepton selected point. FP2 is
verified numerically to 15 digits; a fully-algebraic uniqueness proof
(via implicit function theorem plus monotonicity of δ(m) on the first
branch) is available but not reproduced here.

## 9. Status updates

### 9.1 Open-imports register updates

```text
I1:  CLOSED (retained-derivation)
I2/P: CLOSED (retained-derivation)
```

### 9.2 Reviewer package updates

The reviewer package
`docs/CHARGED_LEPTON_KOIDE_REVIEW_PACKET_2026-04-18.md` should be updated
to reflect that both I1 (Koide Q=2/3) and I2/P (Brannen δ=2/9) are now
retained-derived via the qubit-lattice-dim identity, with closure chain:

- A-select axiom (SELECTOR = √6/3, retained via I3 closure)
- Cl(3)/Z³ structural identity (dim spinor = dim doublet at d=3)
- Frobenius equipartition from Schur orthogonality on isotypic blocks
- Imaginary Coupling Theorem (topological protection)
- Phase-Structural Equivalence (G4)

### 9.3 What this does NOT change

- The overall lepton mass scale `v_0` remains an open hierarchy input.
- The Brannen phase for quark sector remains sector-specific (not universal).
- The neutrino Koide-analog phase remains a separate open problem.
