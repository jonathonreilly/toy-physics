# Architecture Note: Directional Path Measure

**Status:** provisional lead candidate for unitary propagator
**Date:** 2026-04-01

## Propagator

```
amplitude(edge) = exp(i k S_spent) / L^p × exp(-β θ²)
```

- `S_spent = delay - sqrt(delay² - L²)`
- `θ = acos(dx/L)` in 3D, `atan2(|dy|, dx)` in 2D
- `β = 0.8`

The directional weight penalizes edges that deviate from the forward (layer) direction. It is field-independent, scale-free, and multiplicative.

## Tested constraints

| test | 2D DAGs | 3D DAGs |
|---|---|---|
| Born rule (I₃) | 9.2e-16 PASS | — |
| interference (V) | 0.998 PASS | — |
| k=0 → zero | 0.000000 PASS | 0.000000 PASS |
| gravity sign | 90%+ attract | 5/8 attract |
| gravity scaling | R@25 ≥ R@12 PASS | R increases with N |
| family transfer | r=2..5 DAGs, neutral on trees | — |
| R_c compat | 8/10 (2 edge cases) | — |
| decoherence scaling | FAIL (purity rises) | — |
| b-dependence | not fixed (R increases with b) | — |

## What this establishes

The flat path measure (uniform weight over all causal paths) was causing CLT saturation of gravity. Adding a directional continuation preference prevents that saturation while preserving interference, Born rule, and k=0→0.

The directional weight generalizes to 3D as acos(dx/L) without modification.

## What this does not establish

- Decoherence scaling is not addressed. This is expected: the directional weight modifies the unitary propagator, and decoherence is a non-unitary (record/environment) problem.
- The b-dependence (deflection increasing with impact parameter) is not fixed.
- β = 0.8 is empirically chosen. A derivation from the axioms or from the graph's intrinsic geometry is still needed.
- The 2 R_c edge cases mean the weight slightly narrows the zero-field interference threshold at some geometries.

## Axiom connection

- Axiom 6 (continuation prefers local coherence): the weight directly implements this
- Axiom 3 (space inferred): the angle is intrinsic to the graph, not imposed
- This is a path-measure correction, not a new dynamical law

## Next work

The propagator is no longer the bottleneck. The next frontier is:
1. Record/environment architecture for decoherence scaling (independent of propagator)
2. b-dependence as a separate gravity-sector question
3. Principled derivation of β from graph geometry
